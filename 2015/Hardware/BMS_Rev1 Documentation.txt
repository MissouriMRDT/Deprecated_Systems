BMS_Rev1 Documentation


***OUTDATED AND NOT LIKELY TO BE UPDATED****

Sweeping changes were made to this revision, which is not considered complete. Rev 1 is deprecated as design changed to Rev 2.
Rev 1 can still be used, but needs to be completed beforehand.


***REFER TO REV 2 FOR A MORE COMPLETE DOCUMENT****

Notes:

	5V power is currently supplied by a Murata OKI-78SR buck converter with a Pi filter. This should probably be changed, as the OKI is extremely inefficient at low (<200mA) current levels.

	A large, high-current diode at the charger input prevents shorting the battery.

	The logic power switch removes power to the regulator. When switched "off", the only waste power is leakage current is through the main MOSFET, which is very very low. When switched "off", the switch connects to the charger input. (Even when switched off, the 5V logic will be powered up if the charger is connected.)
	
	The 5V Input V Meas is used as pack voltage measurement when the system is switched on. When switched off, it is disconnected from the battery, and connected to the charger input. 

	When the charger is connected, the Charge and 5V Input V Measurements are compared in software. If they are equal (i.e., logic switch is set set to "off", system should be in a "Charge Only" mode. If the logic switch is set to off, the system is powered on and the charger is disconnected, the system will suddenly shut off (as power to the 5V logic would be lost).

	With the Logic switch on, the system may be simultaneously run and charged. This is not necessarily recommended, as it may (or may not) cause odd charger behavior, depending on the external charger. 

	The Balance charger connects to a 9-pin balance lead that passes through the BMS. There are currently 8 differential voltage amplifiers used at each battery, to detect voltage levels. These are costly and may not be used in the final implementation.

	The LT1910 uses a set resistor and acts as a solid-state breaker. As currently designed, it trips at 216A with a .3mΩ Resistor, and has approximately a .5 second delay to reset with a 3.3µF cap
